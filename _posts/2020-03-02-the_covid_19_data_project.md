End of December 2019 first cases of a new pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China. By March 2st, 2020, we know about 80,000 confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths worldwide. Most cases are still located in the Hubei province. However, the virus is spreading all over the world. Apart from Antarctica, there are cases on all continents, with new clusters in South Korea, Iran and Italy. The virus is a big threat for the world.

Mid of January 2020 a group of scientists (Ensheng Dong, Hongru Du, Lauren Gardner) from Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at John Hopkins University (JHU) published an [interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). The raw data can be downloaded from [CSSEGISandData GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The data is collected from different data sources: [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports), [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases), [NHC](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/list_gzbd.shtml) and [DXY](https://ncov.dxy.cn/ncovh5/view/pneumonia?scene=2&clicktime=1579582238&enterid=1579582238&from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0).

As the virus spreads all over the world, the data from the mentioned sources are not longer sufficient. We need more accurate data in real time.

**The goal of this project is to contain the disease by finding insights from high quality data, which we want to gather from different sources**

Please don't stop reading, because you are not data expert or you don't have a technical project. You can support this project right now:

**First, you can help us by telling others about the project, so it goes viral**

There are many ways how you can support this project even as non-data expert:

- We need **people in each of the 192 countries to contact official instutions** in the country to find sources of data
- We need **people in big medical instituitions** who share data with us
- We need **software engineers** for tools around data
- We need **data engineers** for data gathering
- We need **machine learning engineers** for building machine learning models
- We need **data analysts** for finding insights in data
- We need **data journalists/data storytellers** to make the insights understandable to medical institutions and governments
- We need people that **support this project financially**
- We need cloud providers **that provide as resources to run our tools, host our data**
- We need people that **backlink to this site to increase SEO**

Maybe you have your own idea how to support us.
