End of December 2019 first cases of a new pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China. By March 2st, 2020 we know about 80,000 confirmed cases and 3,000 deaths worldwide. The most cases are located in the Hubei province. However, the virus is spreading all over the world. Apart Antarctica there are cases on all continents, with new cluster in South Korea, Iran and Italy.

Mid of January 2020 a group of sciencists (Ensheng Dong, Hongru Du, Lauren Gardner) from Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at John Hopkins University (JHU) published an [interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). The raw data can be downloaded from [CSSEGISandData GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The data is collected from different data sources: [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports), [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases), [NHC](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/list_gzbd.shtml) and [DXY](https://ncov.dxy.cn/ncovh5/view/pneumonia?scene=2&clicktime=1579582238&enterid=1579582238&from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0).

However, as the virus spreads all over the world we need more accurate data and quicker. Therefore I want to collect data.
